8518308,58290971,2016-01-02,37185230,Kelly,"My stay at the Cozy Bachelor pad was amazing! Dragan was a fantastic host, very communicative and made the experience very easy! I would recommend this place very much! Apartment was clean, organized and in an awesome location!! Thanks for a great stay! "
-2670365,58404761,2016-01-02,51264572,Lisa,"This B&B is better than  a 5 star hotel.  It was absolutely beautiful inside and meticulously restored.  We loved this house.  Our host, Mathew, was very helpful and while he was out of town when we arrived, he still ensured someone was there to great us.  The location is also fantastic and within a few blocks of great restaurants and boutique shops.  On a final note, the bed was very comfortable and the linens good quality.  We will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone."
-6004058,58411660,2016-01-02,6848429,Joy,"Marina's place was perfect for us - compact, but with everything we needed, in a charmingly converted hotel building. Check-in and out was easy, Marina was a great host!"
-6020744,58725117,2016-01-03,7454403,Finley,"Wade and his mom, JoJo, were fantastic hosts, giving me everything I needed for the perfect stay!  The apartment is easy to access (right in the middle of Capitol Hill, which is fantastic, but also walking distance to downtown-- the location is literally perfect) and the view is incredible.  It's modernly furnished and I loved it."
4236723,58253443,2016-01-01,52790726,Paul,"This place is great. Chris has been doing this for a while and it shows. Last-minute reservation to check in in no time, everything was clean, the place was nice and warm, and it was all very luxurious. Highly recommended!"
4236723,58359760,2016-01-02,33781615,Kelly,"What a perfect place to stay the night! This charming, historic house is exactly as it's pictured. We stayed in Seattle for New Years Eve and all of the beds were comfy with lots of extra blankets, and Chris encourages you to ""crank the heat"" since the house is 115 years old!

Such lovely welcoming touches like a handwritten card, snacks on the counter and water and soda in the fridge. My hungover friends savored that Sprite the next morning, let me tell you.

Chris was very easy to communicate with, and the house is only blocks from the D-line bus that is a straight shot into downtown. Short walk to all of the great food and coffee Ballard has to offer--this place is a perfect location to be steeped in Ballard awesomeness while having easy access to other parts of the city."
-8691263,58161398,2016-01-01,312655,Joshua,"If you want to explore downtown Seattle this location and apartment are awesome! Seriously. Great building/facilities. Laura was a very good host: clearly communicated everything and even let us drop our bags off early so we could go exploring. Rooms were spotless with awesome views.

The roof is amazing. You're welcome up there- and do go check it at sunrise/sunset. One tiny caveat: during a few events their is a resident guest list to get in to the roof. Like during NYE :( Other than that: super awesome!"
-4593740,58362985,2016-01-02,50077364,Natasha,"Shellie arrived on time to meet us in the parking garage down the block and specially came to meet us during the work day which we appreciated. Upon getting settled in we realized that the kitchen was barely useable. There aren't actual cooking utensils to use so my plans to cook one night ended up not happening. The bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows definitely leave much to be desired so bring your own if you're picky. The shower head was extremely low pressure, and the towels in the bathroom were wet when we arrived. There is cable but no HD or DVR services, so that was a letdown as well. The actual building was great and had a nice location...but overall I wouldn't stay here again."
-6836330,58649269,2016-01-03,51220265,Aly,"The listing is exactly as advertised - very cozy little home, quiet neighborhood, adorable kitties. We really appreciated the extra heater in the bathroom and the coffee/tea and granola for us in the morning! Nice comfy bed, and an overall great experience. 

The house is a little far from anything - at least we weren't able to find groceries or anything close by, although we weren't there for very long, and this didn't really affect our stay. 


"
6762958,58197485,2016-01-01,1286876,Randi,Loved the place. Modern and updated. Had complimentary root beer and beer. Nice bath with heated floors. Nice back yard that could be cool if it wasn't the winter time. Only one complaint is that the bed was too small for two people. Unless your a couple who doesn't move at all at night it was just to hard for us.
8869027,58315849,2016-01-02,2385729,Brenda,"Christopher's place is amazing! My husband and I didn't get a chance to meet him, but Christopher made sure everything was organized and the key drop off went really smooth. His apartment is nicely decorated and so clean! We had a great time, very central and a close walk to bus lines."
-8015531,58315004,2016-01-02,34614144,Louise,"Check in instructions were clear which made the process easy, the apartment is as described and was close to everything we needed. The wifi wasn't working when we arrived but the host had communicated this prior to arrival and was able to amend this the next day."
-8082659,58316502,2016-01-02,11363253,Liz,"Great location.  Nice, clean space that's close to everything you may want to do in Seattle.  Brian was a great host."
-1225820,58286121,2016-01-02,30286367,Erin,"Chelsea's home was the perfect place for us to call home in Seattle for a few days! It's located in a great neighborhood, walking distance to the beach and California Rd that is chock full of gold coffee, eats and restaurants. Her home was cozy, well-stocked with all the basic amenities and we felt right at home. Communication with Chelsea was quick and easy. We didn't cross paths in person but we are confident we would return when we visit Seattle again! "
7860837,58736511,2016-01-03,52723379,Xavi,"Absolutely loved the carriage home. It was clean, well lit, perfect for two, and felt more then welcomed and had all the acomidations needed. They are great hosts and will definitely be staying here many more times when we visit. Again, all I can say is it was perfect and the house was just magnificent. Loved, loved, loved it. You won't find anything better."
-9679301,58404060,2016-01-02,51275159,Ashley,"Mozelle is such a sweet and welcoming person it was easy to feel at home. Her place is well decorated, very clean and in a great location easy to find right near the water. I would gladly visit her home again for my travel needs! "
9995551,58213602,2016-01-01,39238605,Bert,Awesome host! The cottage is nice and clean and Jennifer provides everything that we need. Thank you Jennifer. It was a great trip.
-8616488,58351887,2016-01-02,6984253,Roxanne,"Roy was a great host! He was there when I arrived and was super helpful and responsive when we had questions. The studio is exactly how he describes it and was the perfect size for the two of us! The building is safe and quiet. Capitol Hill was a great location- walking distance to food, drinks, shops, parks, busses, bars, etc. You don't need a car and there are lots of people around and things to do. We never really needed to leave the neighborhood aside from sight seeing and then renting a car and to drive out to the mountains. Overall great trip and would definitely stay at Roy's spot again if we come back!"
7735282,58612561,2016-01-03,8378525,Danielle,"We had a wonderful stay at James' apartment in Capitol Hill.  It's a cosy and well-appointed studio with all the amenities we needed.  James was incredibly helpful and friendly, offering us great suggestions of local bars and restaurants - all of which are only a short walk from the apartment. 3 nights wasn't long enough!
Thanks again James!"
-8517602,58188309,2016-01-01,32093617,Ryan,"Jim was very accommodating to our late arrival- even on NYE. Beautiful, clean house with snacks for breakfast! The house is in a great, quiet location, close to trader joes, Safeway and less than 10 minutes from the Seattle Center. We went to Crow restaurant for a nice dinner and loved it. Über takes you to and from this location easily. Great find in Queen Anne!"
6941113,58136350,2016-01-01,8714260,Michael,"This is a clean, cosy, extremely convenient place to stay in downtown Seattle.  Kaiser is friendly, helpful, low-key and accessible.  A great place in a great city.  "
-3626162,58138366,2016-01-01,46885504,형선,"Elizabeth is awsome host and her husband and childs are kind. She trys to accomodate us and respects our privacy. I and my boyfriend stayed more than a month. In the house, there is everything you need such as plate, spoons and coffee and tea. We had a great time staying this beautiful house. I think this house is the best house near this neighborhood. Thank you for your hosting."
8608233,58235123,2016-01-01,33005883,Alyssa,We had a great time staying at Allen's place! It was just as described and had everything we needed. Allen was easy to communicate with and checking in and out was simple. The condo is in a great location by the Sculpture Park with lots of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. We got there just in time to watch the sunset from the rooftop deck overlooking Elliott Bay. Gorgeous! I would definitely stay here again. 
5787922,58332783,2016-01-02,17477014,Kyle,"Deb was an amazing host! The hospitality was above and beyond what we could've expected - from the couple beers in the fridge, to the chocolates by the bed, to the plethora of clean towels, everything was fantastic. The driveway parking was perfect and allowed us to not have to worry about our car, and the location of the apartment was close enough to Uber around the city with no problems. We would love to stay with Deb anytime we return to Seattle!"
-6327506,58336718,2016-01-02,49033036,Bianca,What an awesome first experience for us using air b&b! Elizabeth and Tyanne's place was simply perfect and we could not have asked for a better experience. They answered all of our questions and even provided a few suggestions about their neighborhood. Their attention to detail made staying their feel like home. We will be back for sure!
-7733192,58227296,2016-01-01,42445644,Jessica,Amazing location and very spacious. David was very helpful and quick to respond! Would definitely stay here again. 
194313,58453967,2016-01-02,11929266,Lynn,"Great location and cute cozy updated studio!  Leah gave great recommendations on restaurants and coffee, and Uber is super cheap to/from the link west lake station that takes you straight to the airport if you have a lot of luggage.  Love the option to do laundry too!"

-7735313,58454229,2016-01-02,2552330,Patricia,Very clean apartment. Everything was as described. The apartment is only one street next to the heart of downtown. James was extremely accommodating. He offered to help and was quick to respond. 
7699495,58160181,2016-01-01,49029343,Dan,"This is a terrific place to stay, centrally located in a well-managed building. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, completely equipped with everything you need. They even supplied ponchos and an umbrella!

The hosts are superb. Extremely responsive and communicative.

Having spent 10 days here, we recommend it highly."
4531944,58476300,2016-01-02,43206423,Julie,I loved how quaint this adorable little cottage was! The area is perfect (Greenlake is a few blocks away and there's a QFC within walking distance)! Communication with Susan was fluid and I always got a response when I reached out to her. 
9866461,58253926,2016-01-01,16113799,Forrest,Eric was incredibly polite and accommodating. His place was clean and as pictured. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. Building has plenty of parking and close to a lot of restaurants and bars. Very convenient and a great value. I would recommend stating here. 
-6479027,58256239,2016-01-01,51078137,Amber,"The room was nice and Cozy. The Bed was perfect. Slept like a baby. The Location was perfect,easy to get on freeways.plenty of street parking. This was our first airbnb experience. We liked having our own floor with bedroom and bathroom. That's all we needed for a quick trip to Seattle. When we visit Seattle again we would book again. "
10118341,58441444,2016-01-02,49912003,Cameron,"My mom and I came for a 4 day trip and had a great stay at Elise's place. She was very friendly and helpful with providing basic directions to get around the area, and the place is a fairly close distance to both Ballard and Downtown, about a $10 uber ride either direction and a close by bus stop. I would stay here again for sure, it was a cute room for a great price! "
-7066118,58412483,2016-01-02,51546568,Lakesha,"Our hosts communicated from the time of our booking until we checked out. We weren't sure about our public transportation options - I texted the hosts and they responded immediately. For our departure, we asked for a late check out and they were fine with it. All in all, a fabulous experience!"
9698202,58249293,2016-01-01,32804192,Dean,"This was an excellent place to stay. 8 buddies and I stayed at this spot for 2 days when exploring Seattle. It was very conveniently located within the city, comfortable, clean, and exactly as advertised. Would definitely stay hear again. "
2969955,58349211,2016-01-02,17436642,Peter,"Heather's home was very comfortable and easily slept four of us.

Overall we had a great stay in Seattle and would definitely recommend the house to anyone looking to visit the city!"
-5242148,58164429,2016-01-01,22387629,Smarak,This was a dream come true vacation for us. Raijina's house is no less than a dream. She was very helpful and accommodated all our requests. I would absolutely use this house when I visit this Seattle again and recommend the same to the community.  
-3543791,58428984,2016-01-02,15761102,Karin,"Clare was a very accommodating host, even from the other side of the country! Her apartment is in a charming, vintage building in one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in Seattle. As a local, I can attest that Clare has a unique, fantastic view of the Space Needle backed by the Olympic Mountains. The view is even more amazing in person than in the photos! Her room is full of lovely plants and charming decor. Next time I need a local getaway in the city, I am definitely going to check here first!
A note for drivers: Capitol Hill can be a challenge to find parking, but this neighborhood has some stretches with free parking available. Just takes a keen eye and a little patience."
493591,58202455,2016-01-01,42865115,Quan,"Flor is like our mom, have a good time here, and I enjoyed the fireworks at the space needle, thanks a lot for taking me there, next time I come Seattle I may stay here again! "

3921664,58682208,2016-01-03,51940463,Haley," We were welcomed by our friendly hosts, who were eager to give advice and suggestions, but also gave us our privacy. The neighborhood is charming, safe, near cafes and restaurants, walking distance to several parks, and a quick bus ride to downtown Seattle. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay! "
-5892185,58418611,2016-01-02,514154,Meg,"Emily and her partner Ryan were great hosts. It was easy to check in, come and go, and check out. Plus Fremont is a fantastic neighborhood and was the perfect home base for exploring."

She provided us with things to see and do in the Ballard neighborhood, and was a friendly face every time we came and went. She had coffee and snacks for us and was easy to communicate with via email and text. I would highly recommend staying with Peggy to anyone and would love to come back the next time we visit. "

It gets plenty of light and has a very comfortable bed. The lock box outside made it easy to access and Brian was great at communicating. Since it is the lower floor you can hear the movement of those living above you, but it wasn't excessively loud. We would definitely stay here again!"
3884851,58432999,2016-01-02,24226616,Chris,"We had a really nice stay at Cindy's room, and felt welcomed. The room and residence were clean and easy to feel comfortable in. Great location with lots of access to fun things to do nearby. They told us about picking up the D-Line bus which had a nearby stop, and knowing that was very helpful. I'd be happy to stay here again."

-5078876,58437754,2016-01-02,8139702,Michael,"The apartment is perfect located on Capitol Hill. It's just a quick easy walk to Broadway and even downtown. When we arrived the apartment was perfectly clean and ready for all four of us to stay comfortably. One of the best features was the garage, parking on Capitol Hill can be very difficult and it saved us so much time and headache. I would highly recommend this apartment and would stay here again any time I visit Seattle. "

9712716,58632693,2016-01-03,8243574,Krista,"My partner and I stayed at Sam's place for a total of four nights over New Year's Eve. We had a great experience - the room was spacious, clean, and nice & quiet. The second bedroom (which you can rent; we stayed in the plaid room) also has a scenic view of downtown, which was great for New Year's Eve fireworks. We also had use of a parking space, which was GREAT as Seattle can be really difficult in terms of parking. Sam himself was also welcoming when we saw him and responded to my emails / texts promptly. No problems with our stay whatsoever. 

Overall, a great stay for a great price. Highly recommended!"
9298045,58218068,2016-01-01,24678902,Nicolas,"Kristin is such a wonderful host! She made this New Year one of our greatest experiences. The room is very clean. The bed is extremely large and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and public transportation is easily accessible. Most importantly, Kristin has been extremely helpful. She promptly gave us detailed guidance on our itineries, and prepared delicious snacks and drinks for us. She even gave us a ride to downtown when we left. So we would definitely recommend Kristin, and would stay with her again if we come back to Seattle. "
-43373,58221019,2016-01-01,17475382,Makayla,"Michael was very nice and accommodating. We stayed during a very cold two days and he did what he could to make sure we were warm. Great location, clean and comfortable. "

-7875887,58220421,2016-01-01,49671109,Ali,"We had a great time in Seattle and Glenn's room made it special. Glenn and Ariel were great hosts and great people. We were lucky to spend the New Year's eve with them. They have an excellent view to the space needle from the roof and we could easily see the fireworks without getting stuck in the street traffic.
The room was exactly as it looks in the pictures. And we had access to everything in the kitchen. 
Parking in the Seattle downtown is a nightmare. They have a parking pass to park in the street which still does not guarantee a spot. They kindly gave us the pass and in top of that saved us a space.
We had a great time at their room and I'd recommend it.  "
-4223597,58213152,2016-01-01,23216972,Ken,"We had a great stay. The house was in a great location and we ended up walking to some great restaurants. I recommend getting the optional parking, because parking can be a nightmare in that neighborhood because it is so close in. "

7035498,58623227,2016-01-03,14723160,Jeanine,"John's place was the perfect stay for my short trip to Seattle. It's a well cleaned, stocked, and situated little studio right in the middle of everything I wanted to do in Seattle. I was able to walk to most places, which is a big plus for me! 

John was an excellent host with great food suggestions and detailed check in and check out instructions! This unit is on the first floor so occasionally you can hear some noises from the street but between my long days of exploring Seattle and the comfy bed; I barely noticed it. Will definitely try to stay here again when back in Seattle!"
-5386937,58181382,2016-01-01,24387315,Sophie,"Lovely, cozy, and convenient! We could walk to so many great restaurants and bars and seemed to be a short drive to anything else in the city. We love Seattle and will definitely remember The Princeton on our next trip! So nice to stay in a place that feels like home-thanks!"
-9797000,58194103,2016-01-01,6670896,Helen,"Abigail and Justin were extremely welcoming. Although they had made previous arrangements to be away for part of the Holidays, they left their numbers and the name and number of friends who would come if needed. Not needed.  They supplied generous goodies for our breakfasts They were also happy to allow us to have a small family party which was ideal because my grandson had room to play with his toys. There were some small difficulties, like dealing with the futon. Justin came and helped us.  The location is excellent, not far from Columbia City (yummy eats) and very convenient to the light rail. All in all an excellent value."
6119821,58186613,2016-01-01,43427129,Christina,"This was my first experience at a hostel and I really enjoyed my stay at Green Tortoise Hostel. Location of Green Tortoise is absolutely undefeatable. It's literally right across street from the Pike Market and is surrounded by all the cool places to eat, drink and shop. The owner Rex was very responsive to my questions before the trip which helped with my trip planning. Staffs working at the hostel are always willing to help and shared with me a lot of tips for where to go and what to see. The hostel was pretty clean and well organized. They do room cleaning every day to take out the trash and vacuum the carpet in each room. They also change the beddings as soon as people check out. There are plenty of private bathrooms for people to use and they are all pretty well maintained (no sharing). Overall, this place really is a good deal for people who are traveling on a budget and willing to make new friends."
6246861,58579964,2016-01-03,49020656,Coreena,"My husband and I had a great stay at James' place. James was an excellent host! He was attentive, hospitible, and very responsive. We also really enjoyed exploring Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle was just a 10 minute walk away. I would definitely recommend staying at James' place!"
-8889257,58308199,2016-01-02,29587235,Aaron,"Andrew/Ellie have the house setup really nice. It was decorated per the description and was very nice from start to finish. 

I think my only concern with this property is the parking situation. It is at the end of a very small cul-de-sac and does not have much room to even drop off luggage.

Other than that, the place is great. My mom loved it so much that she liked to just stay in and enjoy the comforts of the home. The location is great, very close to Seattle Center and awesome views of the Space Needle and the Bay just around the corner. The area is very high end with million dollar homes all around. Very posh in my mind. Great value compared to getting two bedrooms at a hotel.

We really enjoyed the home. One night we bought fresh fish, steak, veggies from Pike Place Market, brought it ""home"" and made a wonderful meal. I say ""home"" because we considered it home. I think we were all a little sad to leave it behind."
-8105351,58188621,2016-01-01,50694568,Chelsea,Loved the cute cottage feel in this house. Was very clean and close to amenities. Host were very nice and fast at responding.

3551668,58183519,2016-01-01,50486130,Tracy,"We just experienced our first Airbnb ar Scott's very comfy apartment.  The location was perfect as our daughter lives nearby and we were within walking distance of many great restaurants and shops. As others mentioned, the bed is very comfortable as is the large sectional sofa.  The unit was very clean and well equipped, but we were disappointed there was no cork screw. Luckily, the Safeway is not too far. 

Don't miss Bakery Nouveau on 15th...a short walk with exceptional bread, pastries and more.

We slept well in the quiet bedroom and loved the Apple TV as well.  We will definitely book again next time we are in town."

The location can't be beat - close to two great coffee shops as well as Ken's Market, restaurants, to say nothing of the Woodland Park Zoo. We'll be back!"

-3245876,58415770,2016-01-02,18772042,Gabriel,"Our stay at Libby's was great. The room had a lot of good amenities like a microwave, mini fridge and toaster. She also provided towels. It was well organized and had a lot of guides and info on Seattle. 

The view from the terrace is cool except it was too cold to actually use it, but in the summer it should be great. 

The location was ideal. Just a 20 minute walk to the space needle and 30 minutes to downtown. "

-856550,58189986,2016-01-01,39168808,Mari,"I had a great experience with JM. He greeted my boyfriend and I at the door when we arrived and provided everything we need for our stay in the room. The place was very adorable with the bunnies and chickens around. I highly recommend  checking the cabin out. The only downside is the separate restroom because we went during the winter. It was cold! Besides that, everything was great! The view from Queen Anne is amazing at night!"

And the place was so clean! Loved having covered parking and I appreciated the helpful book with local markets and info about the house. Mimmi was easy to communicate with (fast to respond and clear with instructions etc) and she reached out just to check in which was so thoughtful. We hope to return in the warmer months!"

It was a quiet, cozy place to come back to at the end of a busy day.  The Queen Anne neighborhood is safe and friendly, and conveniently close to downtown.  Highly recommend."
4848255,58299882,2016-01-02,9010696,Justin,Luan was gracious and welcoming. A fantastic host I would recommend to anyone. His space in Seattle is functional and a convenient drive to some essential attractions.

Didn't have a chance to meet her personally but was greeted with a nice note, wine, and some snacks! She gave all these great recommendations for restaurants and activities to do. Would definitely stay at her place again if I came back to Seattle. The room was very clean and comfortable. Location is pretty good too. Walkable distance (10-15 min) to cafes, restaurants,etc."
6637899,58617999,2016-01-03,1970742,Kristina,"I stayed with Eileen for one month during my relocation to Seattle from the Bay Area. Moves are stressful in the best of circumstances, but during the winter holiday season it's particularly hard not to be in the cozy familiarity of your own home. 

The hospitality and generosity Eileen showed me during my stay remind me of the reason Airbnb exists: to make you feel at home, anywhere. 

During my time with Eileen (and Higgs, easily the coolest, sweetest dog I've ever met), she made me feel completely at home in her beautiful, spacious, overflowing with charm Craftsman. She really loves Seattle and all of her recommendations (where to eat, shop, find the best coffee, pastries, etc.) were spot on—and I'm pretty selective. 

Also, it can be tough to share a space with another human—even if it's temporary (I usually rent entire apartments or homes). Eileen is both accessible and very respectful of privacy. I enjoyed many lovely conversations with her but also enjoyed having my own space. 

All in all, Eileen made a stressful transition month so much easier and more enjoyable. If you want a beautiful, cozy home away from home, unbeatable city location, and sage local recommendations, you should definitely book a stay here. "
-774659,58369317,2016-01-02,15706273,Chee Heng,"The house is simple and minimalist design but fully equipped with everything that we need. The kitchen is the highlight, plenty of pots and pans are provided, more than enough to prepare a simple dinner. The location is good, close to supermarket and restaurants."
2197168,58199040,2016-01-01,40730787,Damien,That was one of our best stays through AirBnB. The house is small but cozy. The kitchen is very well appointed so if you like to cook this is a great choice. The location close to the rail station is also especially convenient. Will definitely rent again.
3382533,58378561,2016-01-02,16381279,Laura,My husband and I had a very nice time. We were very comfortable and had everything we needed. Andrea communicated with us throughout the trip to ensure it was a smooth stay.

-7884782,58353282,2016-01-02,25619191,Doug,"James' place was fantastic, and easily one of the best we've stayed in. He was very communicative and worked with us when our train arrived late at night, and even extended an invite to his NYE plans. His apartment was spotless and near lots of great food, and we were able to have some great meals from his list of suggestions. The location is super convenient to downtown Seattle, and we were able to walk/Uber everywhere. Would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle!"

769213,58268062,2016-01-02,13970857,Peter,"The place was great!  Clean and quiet, though literally 2 mins from all that Capitol Hill has to offer.  Soaking tub is incredible and luxurious way to end the day.  Was concerned that earplugs and other sleep kit items were provided due to noise.  Definitely not!  Place is very quiet and chill.  Sleep kit just another of the many amenities KT provides in the place.  Back yard is a little funky, but all part of the charm.  Stay here if you are artsy and want a small, clean place in a great location."
4608208,58484435,2016-01-02,9072709,My,Sallie was very welcoming. My girlfriend and I had a very lovely stay with Sallie. The room was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely consider staying there again!

Denise was great to work with, super responsive and ready to help even before we arrived with tips about the area and things to do for our entire family.

The home is fantastic (we may be slightly biased as we live in a Victorian home ourselves - coincidentally built the same year as this property).  It is tastefully remodeled yet keeps all the charm and character of its era. It is extremely clean, comfortable (perfect for our family of four), cozy, well updated and best of all in an AMAZING location, walking distance from many attractions, restaurants, supermarkets and shops."
-4287974,58224010,2016-01-01,15404472,Claudia,"Dan's home was a perfect place for me, my fiancée, and two friends on New Year's Eve.  We all sat around the fire and watched the fireworks and ball drop from his TV in the living room with surround sound, which was perfect. Both rooms and beds were comfortable and cozy.  The location is great with a view of Seattle right outside.  I got to meet Dan and his family and they are the sweetest people you could ever meet.  We were lucky to have found his home.  Highly recommended!"

1633986,58405955,2016-01-02,5680873,Carla,"One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. The place itself was absolutely beautiful: the views, the openness, and the amount of light that filled the entire space. Of course, location is key, and it was perfect for our stay and what we wanted to do. It was just a few minutes from downtown and the neighborhood had so many cool restaurants! Overall, it was incredible stay ;) "
-762029,58146498,2016-01-01,8262574,Sandy,"This is my second stay with JM, and it was as awesome as the first. Such a cool space, perfect location, great price for someone who is looking for safe, warm, and fun without all the unnecessary space. Highly highly highly recommended."

The private entry to the rental is nice.  The kitchen has the basics for a pleasant stay.  It was good to have a separate bedroom with a closet to hang cloths.  I could see coming here for a longer stay easily.

It was a quiet and cozy place and I would be happy to stay there again some time.

6361863,58212254,2016-01-01,8896468,Holly And Ben,"This home was just perfect for us 3 adults and a baby - my hubby and I took the sofa bed which was comfortable and in a spacious room. Our friend slept very well in the Master bedroom. Bathroom was bright and clean with an incredible shower. There were random noises like the furnace going on and off so if you're a light sleeper like me bring ear plugs. Also, you're in a separate unit from the home owners but you can hear them walking and talking upstairs. Unfortunately the fridge wasn't working which was an inconvenience with the baby but we were given notice prior and brought an icebox. The location is superb - in quaint Queen Anne with walking distance to the main strip. Free parking right infront of the house was great. Overall we had an exceptional stay and would highly recommend the place. One our top airbnb stays. Thank you Kurt and Anna for being prompt and very accommodating! "

Her entire apartment is cozy and has nice views of the surrounding neighborhood. Susan wants to ensure you feel at home by giving you full access to her specialty teas and providing spa-like shampoo, conditioner, etc. Also, I had the best sleep of my life on the room's bed - certainly a restful escape from the busy city. She has lots of tourist resources and brochures to help you decide how to spend your time in Seattle. She will gladly give you recommendations on restaurants, activities, etc, or let you be if you wish for peace and quiet. Her place is a convenient 10-15 min walk to pike's market. 

The surrounding neighborhood is relatively safe. Just be aware and smart when walking home at night from the downtown area.

This was a wonderful place to begin using airbnb and I will certainly return the next time I visit Seattle. I highly recommend for anyone - whether you are a tourist seeing Seattle, on a business trip, or just need a relaxing staycation. "

The house has been renovated nicely but still felt relaxed enough to let our kids enjoy as well; there were lots of toys downstairs as well. The open kitchen and living room make a nice sized room for us all to enjoy hanging out together. Cathy responded in minutes to our original request and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. The location was great, within 15 minutes to downtown, the zoo and Bellevue. Thanks Cathy!"

We loved the neighbourhood. Everything was within walking distance and we loved using Seattle's app valet service to park our car instead of worrying about street parking. Top pot doughnuts right next door are to die for! We loved the salted caramel.
I can't say enough good things about this apartment and the city of Seattle. Really looking forward to recommending this spot to friends and family.  Thank you for an excellent experience Marianne!"

They are both very kind and considerate, giving us great recommendations of where to eat or enjoy coffee. And their home locates in a terrific location for visitors who don't have a car, which is less than five minutes to Dline station heading to Seattle downtown.  

Since we have a tight schedule visiting Seattle this time,  there's not much time spending quality time with them but we still had great time chatting with Airbnb App. 

Next time I visit Seattle, I will definitely choose Javier and Yeon 's home."

Mack was also flexible enough to allow us to arrive early and drop off our bags so we could make an early food tour. The balcony has gorgeous views of the islands, and pike place is a 5 minute walk. Trending restaurants and bars are in every direction, also walking distance. I would highly encourage this place to anyone looking to stay in downtown. "

We spent a lot of time in the home with our kids as they were so content there and we could sit and read or rest after our adventures. A great spot close to everything especially the city. Beautiful surroundings, comfortable beds and everything we could have wanted and more. Analisa was prompt to answer any questions we had and had great tips and advice for us. This was our first airbnb experience and we won't look back now! Thank you Analisa! p.s. the little quirks and things to do within your house were a charm :)"

I give the owner, Chris, a lot of credit for making everything go so smoothly. His communication was clear and very organized. The house was great for our needs. The only thing I would mention is that the loft is finished and a great spot but its really meant for young set that can climb up and into the loft. It is not easy to get up there. We had six of us stay and that was a very full house. We used the Airstream which was a great option.  I'd love to have the whole house next time, not just the top floor. Bottom line, great location, good parking, great snacks and drinks provided by owner and comfortable beds. Really a good experience! Thanks Chris!"

4526943,58266844,2016-01-02,15930110,Alex,"My girlfriend and I are currently traveling the states while she does travel nursing contracts. We stayed in Daniella's Capitol Hill unit for 13 weeks (Oct-December) while my girlfriend worked a contract at Swedish Hospital in First Hill. The location is perfect. It's a close distance to many great neighborhoods but also in a nice quiet residential part of the city so you get the best of both world's. We walked everywhere (even Fremont sometimes). There is a garage if you need to use a car though. It's on a hill and can be a pain to back out of. I scraped the lower front portion of my car quite a bit (unavoidable) but it was very minor damage and may be minimized with a rubber strip or frame that isn't low to the ground.

Upon arriving Daniella greeted us and gave us a quick walk-through and addressed any questions we had. She was quick to respond to any issues that came up through the months we were living there. The unit is split into four apartments and all the other neighbors were friendly and quiet. The shared washer and dryer is located in the basement and works well. 

The apartment is fully furnished. Everything seemed recently renovated and really well kept. Internet was fast and all appliances worked well. It was the nicest short term unit we've stayed in so far. It's a professionally managed unit. We highly recommend a visit and will try to book again when we come back to Seattle. "

He greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour and provided suggestions of places to see and eat. The neighborhood is low key with plenty of free parking on the street. We enjoyed our stay so much we asked Kevin on the day of check-out if we could extend our stay. Lucky for us, Kevin said, ""no problem!"" Would recommend to family and friends. "
1562643,58292451,2016-01-02,27128371,Catherine,"I reserved Robert's place for three nights and arrived and accessed it with ease. House rules were quite meticulous which I understand as I'd be the same for my own house; however as an Airbnb, it may be a little bit overkill. Despite so, his house is very clean and nicely renovated; this location is quite close to and from downtown via car but not as convenience without a car. 

We arrived with cleaners that were still there till about 6PM which was a tad inconvenient as we didn't want to interfere by any means as a courtesy. We appreciate that Robert went out of his way to secure a cleaner so we can get the reservation but there were dirty/used dishes already in the dishwasher and there were food left in the refrigerator beforehand so with the rules. We felt that we had to document our stay to make it clear to Robert that this was not part of our stay to avoid any charges or misunderstandings. 

It was a wonderful stay nonetheless.m and definitely recommend it. Thanks again Robert. "

The bed in the apartment was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. My only complaint is the slower internet speed we experienced,  which was not too big of a deal since we were out and about most of the day. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and we would definitely stay here again. "

Kevin and Louis are easy going, down to earth people who have their system so simplified it goes beyond refined. 

The house itself is cozy with everything you need: comfy bed, clean sheets, bathroom dedicated to guests, coffee outside our door. The cats are a bonus, and bonus bonus, they love attention. 

The location can't be beat; everything you can ask for is just blocks away. 

Our last minute request was responded to very quickly and communication was a snap. 

These guys are pros!! Thanks! "

It's a pity that we could not cook there, and all the time if at home you could only stay in the base room, so if you come with family you might better choose another cook place "

We felt very welcome in this home and enjoyed spending time in Seattle.

We would definitely refer this property and are happy to have met both Mike and Paulina."

Would stay again."

Didn't get to meet our hosts, but they made it very easy for us to get into the room and they were very accommodating.  I would highly recommend a stay here for anyone looking for accommodations in the Ballard area"

Luckily, the housekeeper was walking by and between him and a call to Michael, we managed to get the door unstuck. Michael was very apologetic about the door and hopefully, by the time you read this, he's gotten it fixed like he hoped.

Inside the apartment looked exactly like the photos although less white and more beige. It's spacious, quiet, and warm. The bed is probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in my life. Slept like a rock. 

It was a very cold night so we Uber'd to the Space Needle but walked back. In the morning, we walked to The Market as well. Everything's close and easy to get to. 

We never got to meet Blake Lively though. Ah well."

Jon was quick to respond to all my questions and very accommodating with my request re check in time.
Everything in the house was as described and great hot tub with a view of Mount Rainier by day and a beautiful view of Bellevue skyline by night.
All in all we had a fab Christmas in Seattle. X "
