# Slalom Case Study
### Question: What is the impact of rain and temperature on listing vacancies in Seattle in 2016?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_The challenge:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My customer wants to know how the 2016 weather patterns affected the Air B&B vacancies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possibly side study: How is tourism affected as a result of Air B&Bs vacancy levels?_

## Overview <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dataset was challengeing in that it took me a while to understand what my goal was. In my opinion, if you don't know what your goal is and what you want to achieve, you will end up coding in circles and not really having a straight focus of what you want. I took some time to re-read the question that I had chosen. I looked over the data in more depth so I can become more familiar with it. Knowing what wa son each page helped me understand the data, what it was telling me, and most important, what I could learn from it. Diving into my familiarity with Python, I got started.<br>

## Data Integration<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin the challenge, I got started by organizing my though process through a conceptual diagram using Quick DBD. This was something we learned in class to help us begin projects that helped identify commonalities between the csv's.<img align="right" img width="550" height="350" alt="dec_temps" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89173945/163296337-e0d2603b-4184-4231-ae7a-f3b8e8a37d6d.png"> From there I was able to identify key/similar columns to which I could possibly merge. From there I went to my strength in Python using Jupyter Notebook. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the focus was to be on 2016, I collected the data from that year from all the files. There are additional studies that could happen if you are looking at comparable years, i.e. 2015 vs 2016 vs 2017. However our focus was only on 2016 at this juncture. I manipulated the data through Python and began processing them through Tableau. To me this is an important step in creating visuals to pair up with the numbers as there will be multiple learners in the room.

## Data Challenges and Resolutions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While trying to merge the data, I worked through creating tables on SQL, however I was not able to resolve this issue. I have exposure to SQL, however not enough to feel confident given the time restriction and I would want to do more research and practicum on SQL to become familar with its enginuity. I did feel as though I was missing some data. I felt as though I did not have a difinitive "vacancy dates" to which I could assign. However I did have avaialability that was a T/F column to which I could utilize as a value if an Air B&B was available during that date in the calendar database. With more experience with it, I am sure machine learning would have given me the correct answer. However I am learning and eagar to do so. For now, I used Tableau as a visual example to show my findings/

## Q&A

What I would have enoyed digging in more is:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is Seattle Trending? - How does the popularity of Air B&B trend in the Seattle Area<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What property has the highest reviews and why? - How are the different properties rated and why? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes them so wonderful/desired?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year to Year Analysis - How does the weather compair from one year to the next and how is the Air B&B market effected?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports History - How does the success of sporting teams, like the Seahawks and Mariners, affect the success of the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Air B&B market?<br>



**Thank you all for your consideration.**
